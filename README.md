# EECS560 - University of Kansas - Spring 2019

This repository contains my work for EECS560 for the Spring 2019 semester.

## Restrictions

* All labs are done in C++, and must be able to compile on the School's lab machines, which limits us to g++ 5.4.0. This means most modern c++ additions are not available. Most labs are compiled with `-std=c++11` just to have `nullptr`
* For our labs, we were not allowed to use anything from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
* Additionally, we were not allowed to use strings (no `#include <string>`). This means many of my labs will use a character buffer in order to read in data that would be much easier to do with strings.

## Goals

For working on these labs, I have set myself some goals

* Follow [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles when designing my labs. This mainly means I will attempt to use inheritance to the fullest when designing labs with multiple parts.
* Clean code, and comments when the aim of the code is unclear
* Some labs may fall short, due to trying to hit deadlines. I'm just a college student after all. In these cases I may redo portions of my labs after submission. This will be indicated in a comment in my code.

## Purpose

* I have put my labs on Github for future reference for myself.
* I hope that this could be educational for others, but not as a way for other students to cheat. If you are an instructor and wish for me to remove these labs, please send me an email at contact@damianvu.com.
* I have also restricted myself from uploading labs until after the due date for my course.
